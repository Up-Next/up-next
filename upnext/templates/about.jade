        p Welcome to UpNext! UpNext is a tool for collaborative playlist building, perfect for listening to music in any group setting. Users can create a playlist, add tracks, upvote songs they like, and downvote songs they don't like. Tracks are played in descending order of their score (upvotes minus downvotes). Songs that have been downvoted below -10 will be removed from the playlist.
