# Introduction
Welcome to [UpNext](http://www.up-next.me/)! UpNext is a tool for collaborative playlist building, perfect for listening to music in any group setting. Users can create a playlist, add tracks, upvote songs they like, and downvote songs they don't like. Tracks are played in descending order of their score (upvotes minus downvotes). Songs that have been downvoted below the minimum score set by the host will be removed from the playlist.

# Getting Started
You need a Spotify account in order to get started with UpNext. (Sign up for a free account [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/signup/)!) Log in to your Spotify account on the [homepage](http://www.up-next.me) to get started.

# Creating a Playlist
Click [`+ Create a party`](http://www.up-next.me/create) in the toolbar to make a new playlist. You must provide the following information:
- **Party name:** The display name for your playlist, for instance `Cool Party 007`.
- **Url:** A unique custom url at which the voting on the playlist will occur, for instance `cool-party-007`. Accessed as `up-next.me/party/cool-party-007`.
- **User nickname:** The display name for the creator of the playlist, for instance `James Bond`.
- **Min score:** The threshold score for your playlist. A song with a lower score than this number is automatically removed.
- **Load songs from any of your playlists:** To create a new playlist, select the default option, `Start a new playlist`.

Note that the valid values for each of the input fields are as follows:
- **Party name:** Alphabet, numbers, spaces, dashes, underscores, apostrophes, exclamation marks.
- **Url:** Alphabet, numbers, dashes.
- **User nickname:** Alphabet, spaces.
- **Min score:** Integer less than 0.

If all of the fields are validated, you will be taken to a successful creation page. From here, click `Party Time!` to see your Party detail page.

**Please note** that the new playlist is **not** created under your Spotify account.

# Loading from a Playlist
On the [`+ Create a party`](http://www.up-next.me/create) page, you may also choose to create an UpNext Party using an existing Spotify playlist that you own. To do this, select a playlist from the dropdown **Load songs from any of your playlists** menu.

Please not that you must still provde a Party name, URL, nickname, and min score.

# Adding Tracks
On the custom page for your Party, use the search bar to look up songs on Spotify that you wish to add to your playlist. Use the player to listen to a 30-second snippet of the song, and hit the `+` button if you wish to add the song to your playlist.

If you want to make a different search, simply use the search bar on the results page.

# Voting
At any given time, the Party detail page will show you the list of upcoming songs, ordered by their score.

Use the upvote/downvote buttons next to each track in order to change the track's score. If your vote changes play order, the song will move up/down automatically.
